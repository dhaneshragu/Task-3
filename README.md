# What is this for?
This is my attempt towards task-3 of Open Source as part of Coding Week tasks by Coding Club IITG.

# Contents
## Commentator:
 The commentator.yml action adds a comment to every PR created with repository name in which PR is made and a meme.
## Lableing101:
  This lableing101.yml action works on issues created and assigns a label help-needed if no label is added. After the issue has been assigned, it assigns a Assigned label and removes helper-label and when issue is closed, it adds Closed label and deletes the other unrequired labels.
